# IGENIO: Twitter Idea Generator
What do you do when you can't think of an idea for a project? . . . You just build an app that finds you new project ideas. With this app I've given some utility and novelty to the user who's drawing a blank. The app brings you a random idea from the mouth of a real person via Twitter.
## Techonlogies Used
- Node & Express Server 
- Twit package for the TWitter API
